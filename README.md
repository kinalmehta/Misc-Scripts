# Misc-Scripts

Here we store our basic OS setup scripts after fresh install of the OS.

**NOTE:** You may not be able to use this like a bash script. So, just open the file and run the commands of the applications you require.

## 1. Linux Setup

Refer [fedora_setup.sh](./fedora_setup.sh) and [mint_ubuntu_setup.sh](./mint_ubuntu_setup.sh)

- text editors (Sublime Text and VS Code)
- zsh and setup oh-my-zsh and its plugins
- chrome
- miniconda for python development
- tmux
- nvidia-drivers
- docker and nvidia-docker extention
- VMWare

## 2. Bash Prompt

Refer [bashrc_custominit.sh](./bashrc_custominit.sh)

- This is used to define common alias and make PS1 more colorful and informative
